Before C++11, you needed to use a library like Boost.Lambda to take advantage of lambda functions. Since
C++11, this library can be regarded as deprecated because lambda functions are now part of the programming
language. If you work in a development environment that doesnâ€™t support C++11, you should consider Boost.Phoenix
before you turn to Boost.Lambda. Boost.Phoenix is a newer library and probably the better choice if you need to
use lambda functions without C++11
